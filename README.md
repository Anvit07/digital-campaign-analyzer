AI-powered analytics project that simulates ad campaign data, calculates key KPIs (CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, ROAS), 
and uses AI (ChatGPT / OpenAI) to generate executive-level insights automatically.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **notebooks/** → Jupyter / Colab notebooks with Python code
- **dashboard/** → Power BI or Tableau dashboard files
- **README.md** → Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab (`notebooks/campaign_analyzer.ipynb`)
2. Run all cells to generate campaign data and KPIs
3. Download the generated CSV from Colab
4. Open Power BI / Tableau, import the CSV and build visuals for ROAS, CTR, CPC, etc.
